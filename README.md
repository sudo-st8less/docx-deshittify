# docx-deshittify
Python script to fix .docx formatting bugs. Unwanted extra pages, tables, header/footer and paragraph formatting metadata can persist after it's deleted in the GUI, especially across Google Docs &amp; Office365. This fixes the formatting issues the WYSIWYG editors gaslight you into thinking aren't there.
